free alternative to yoga class-booking apps (like mindbody)

Inspired by how terrible the mindbody app is in addition to how much they screw over small, independent yoga studios and similar businesses with their fee structures I have decided to make an open-source not for profit competitor with better performance, flexibility, and a variety of features using python, fastapi, Jinja, Kotlin or java (for eventual Android app), and PostgreSQL.  Still working on a name for app (freemind is just the project).  Suggestions welcome.
